## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts railway train delays using Machine Learning algorithms and visualizes delay insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The system analyzes multiple real-world factors such as:

- Station
- Weather Conditions
- Passenger Count
- Day of Week
- Scheduled Time

and predicts:

- Delay Minutes (Regression)
- Delay Status: Delayed or On-Time (Classification)

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

• Predict train delay time using regression models  
• Classify trains as delayed or on-time  
• Identify delay patterns using clustering  
• Visualize railway insights using Power BI
